# AR-MeshVoxelization


This project is an experiment in voxelization of mesh created with ARFoundation.

The base of the algorithm is referenced in this repository.

Unity : 2020.3.33

how to use

 1. launching the application, scan the around area and create a mesh.  
 2. After scanning the area to be voxelized, press the "Step 1" button.
 3. When the scanned area changes color, scan the same area again with
 4. the camera. Finally, press the "step2" button to voxelize the mesh.

*I haven't debugged it much, so there may be bugs.
